# Groups

```math
x + y => \text{composition} \\[10px]

G = \left\{ a,b,c\right\} \\[10px]

\text{we can create a group from this point}
```

## Axioms

1) Closure

Closed system, elements should be matched in a group, cannot get new element

2) Associativity

```math
 (x\,o\,y) \,o\, z =  x\,o\,( y\,o\, z)

```

## Set Permutations 

```math
a \Longrightarrow  x \\[10px]
b \Longrightarrow  y \\[10px]

```

we can create cycles and permutations from a set to another set.

## Identity Element

```math
 (x\,o\,y) = x
```
identity element returns the same element after operation.


## Inverses


```math
 (x\,o\,x^{-1}) = e
```

e is identity element, therefore any element from group every element should follow this process.


## Abelian Commutativity / (Further Subject)

```math
 (x\,o\,y) =  (y\,o\,x) 

```

This property of abelian group is not generalzied in all groups. Therefore, commutativity is not an axiom in the system.


## Symmetric Groups

Symettric group is n element system composed by permutations of n elements. It is very abstract topic.

### Axioms:
* identity element exists,
* Inverse exists for every element,
* Associativity (στ)ρ=σ(τρ)
* Closed

```math

 S_{3} = \left\{1,2,3\right\} \\[10px]
 Permutations \left\{1,2,3\right\} \\[10px]
 (1,2,3) → (1,2,3)\\[10px]
 (1,2,3) → (2,1,3)\\[10px]
 (1,2,3) → (3,2,1)\\[10px]
 (1,2,3) → (2,3,1)\\[10px]
 (1,2,3) → (3,1,2)\\[10px]
 (1,2,3) → (1,3,2)\\[10px]
```
