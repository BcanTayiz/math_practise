# Groups

```math
x + y => \text{composition} \\[10px]

G = \left\{ a,b,c\right\} \\[10px]

\text{we can create a group from this point}
```

## Axioms

1) Closure

Closed system, elements should be matched in a group, cannot get new element

2) Associativity

```math
 (x\,o\,y) \,o\, z =  x\,o\,( y\,o\, z)

```
