# Groups

```math
x + y => \text{composition} \\[10px]

G = \left\{ a,b,c\right\} \\[10px]

\text{we can create a group from this point}
```

## Axioms

1) Closure

Closed system, elements should be matched in a group, cannot get new element

2) Associativity

```math
 (x\,o\,y) \,o\, z =  x\,o\,( y\,o\, z)

```

## Set Permutations 

```math
a \Longrightarrow  x \\[10px]
b \Longrightarrow  y \\[10px]

```

we can create cycles and permutations from a set to another set.

## Identity Element

```math
 (x\,o\,y) = x
```
identity element returns the same element after operation.


## Inverses


```math
 (x\,o\,x^{-1}) = e
```

e is identity element, therefore any element from group every element should follow this process.


## Abelian Commutativity / (Further Subject)

```math
 (x\,o\,y) =  (y\,o\,x) 

```

This property of abelian group is not generalzied in all groups. Therefore, commutativity is not an axiom in the system.
