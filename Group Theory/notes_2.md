# Group Isomorphisms

By closed systems, closed operational symmetry could be named as Isomorphic group. If group is isomorhpic then there should be a map between two groups

Bijective rule applies fro isomoprhic groups

```math
Y: G \to G^-1 \\[10px]
\text{bijective process}\\[10px]
Y(\,a\,o\,b) = Y(a) \, o \, Y(b)


```
